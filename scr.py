He sinks it again, but this time in a more improbable way. The putt seems to take a magical turn on an embankment a little too well.\n\nBRIDGE FINANCIER #1 & BRIDGE FINANCIER #2 are shocked. THE PRODUCER doesn't flinch.\n\nTHE PRODUCER: \"The film's 90% complete. And we're targeting the City Film Fest and Market. We're just looking for little bridge financing.\"\n\nBRIDGE FINANCIER #2: \"We understand. We do require an accounting audit...\"\n\nTHE PRODUCER gives the No Problem thumbs up.\n\nBRIDGE FINANCIER #2: \"...and a rough cut of the film before any decision is made.\"\n\nTHE PRODUCER: \"It's funny you bring up the edit. The main selling point of the production is EDIE, an AI editing and story-telling genius. It searches the web and knows what's hot; blockbusters; it can't miss... My older brother's friend invented it.\"\n\nBRIDGE FINANCIER #1 (unenthusiastic): \"Incredible. Please send us the rough cut and books by tomorrow.\"\n\nTHE PRODUCER looks slightly concerned.",

THE DIRECTOR completely misses this irony.\n\nSocial Media Breadcrumbs: The kids are posting their planning process online - \"Demolition jump tomorrow at dawn! 🔥🎬\" - which is how EDIE discovers the exact timing through its web scraping capabilities.\n\nFound Cinema Artifacts: Maybe the kids have been exploring the condemned theater and found old film reels in the dumpster, which they're now using as \"decorations\" around their jump setup. Cinema history literally becoming props for their stunt.\n\nThe Meta Layer: These kids are doing exactly what THE DIRECTOR's documentary crew is doing - making a film about a specific location at a specific time - but with pure enthusiasm instead of intellectual pessimism.\n\nEquipment Contrast: Their tiny handheld camcorder vs. THE DIRECTOR's elaborate film setup creates a visual joke about \"professional\" vs. \"amateur\" filmmaking, tying into the movie's themes about AI vs. human creativity.\nThis makes EDIE's fascination with their footage even more pointed - the AI recognizes something authentic and joyful that the pretentious human filmmaker dismissed as worthless.\n\n*****\n\nFrom the ashes of the death of cinema rises the next generation. it is different, but cinema is not dead.\n\n*****\n\nOpen questions:\n\nWouldn't it be nice if the kids could sort of unknowingly pay homage to the history of cinema in some way? Perhaps their arrangement of cinema artifacts rubble for their \"gap jump\" sort of does this.\n\nAlso, how will the chaos of this scene happen and fall apart in a Rube Goldberg machine kind of way such that the THE DIRECTOR gets injured by his own doing, so to speak. \n\nShould the gap jump happen at the demolition time (demolition will have to be AI/CGI)? That would make the coolest shot. Or maybe we see demolition happen at the crack of dawn, and then they arrange the filmmaking rubble and are planning their shot for as soon as the sun peaks over the horizon.\n\n🤔\n\nKeep in mind, these are all suggestions and ideas. You can offer your own input that you think will make this story and scene better.",
